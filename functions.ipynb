This isn't necessary for the code to function, but it makes it much more readable. In Python, it's conventional to name functions descriptively using lowercase letters, with underscores separating multiple words.\n","\n","\n","- the function has two _positional_ __parameters__, `a` and `b`. This means `a` and `b` are assigned _in order_. It may help to think of parameters as placeholders for values that are taken as input when the function is called. \n","\n","\n","- a colon `:` and a newline take us to the body of the function. Notice after the newline we have an indented block. This block defines the _internal_ workings of the function, and effectively acts as a lockbox, preventing anything outside the function from seeing the internal data.\n","\n","\n","- there's another keyword, `return` that tells Python what information to pass outside of the code block. `return` passes the information on to whichever process called the function. So for example if we run: `type(add_squares(1,2))`, the interpreter will first evaluate `add_squares(1,2)` and then pass that answer along to the `type()` function, which should spit out `int`.
